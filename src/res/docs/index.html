	<h2>KeePassX project in short</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="http://keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> <img src="external.png" /> (KPX) 
		is a cross-platform password manager program. 
		It is mainly designed to be used on *nix platforms,
		such as Linux and Mac OS X.
	</p>
	<p>
		KeePassX currently uses same the database file
		format as the <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> <img src="external.png" /> 
		1.x (Classic) password manager software for Windows.
		Although a Windows build for KPX exists, it is
		recommended to use the original KeePass on Windows, as
		it has more features and is more matured on the platform.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that KeePassX and KeePass are entirely 
		separate projects, maintained by two separate groups of people
		and consequently, share no common codebase.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thank you for using KeePassX!
