	<h3 class="question">Q: What password database formats are compatible with KeePassX?</h3>
	<p class="answer">
	A: KeePassX currently uses the KeePass 1.x (Classic) password database format as
	the native format. It can also import KeePassX 1.x XML exports, PwManager databases
	and KWallet XML databases. KeePass 2.x database format is not supported.
	</p>

	<h3 class="question">Q: Can I open KeePass 2.x password databases with KeePassX?</h3>
	<p class="answer">
	A: No, KeePassX does not support the KeePass 2.x (.kdbx) password database 
	format currently.
	However, you can create an export in KeePass 1.x database format (.kdb) from 
	KeePass 2.x, which KeePassX can read (and use as the native password database).
