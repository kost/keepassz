	<h2>Installation from binary</h2>
	<p>
		Easiest way to use KeePassX is to install from a binary. Ready-built
		binaries are available for all commonly used Linux distributions
		from their respective binary package repositories. Binaries for
		Mac OS X and Windows are available at the <a href="http://keepassx.org/">
		project web site</a> <img src="external.png" />.
	</p>
	<p>Installation commands for some Linux distributions:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt><b>Ubuntu Linux</b></dt>
		<dd><tt>sudo apt-get install keepassx</tt>
		<br><br>or use Synaptic Package Manager from the 
		<b>System</b> > <b>Administation menu.</b></dd>
	<dt><b>Fedora</b></dt>
		<dd><tt>su -<br>yum install keepassx</tt></dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Installation from source</h2>
	<p>
		If your distribution doesn't have ready-built binary for
		KeePassX or you would like to try out latest SVN version
		of KeePassX, you can try building from source. Instructions
		can be found at the <a href="http://www.keepassx.org/howto">
		project web site</a> <img src="external.png" />.
