	<h1>KeePassX Quick-start Guide</h1>
	<p>
		This guide helps you to manage your
		passwords efficiently and securely with KeePassX.
	</p>

	<a name="startup" />
	<h2>Starting up</h2>
	<p>
		After starting KeePassX for the first time, you
		are presented with the main window with
		no open database file. If you have used KeePassX
		(or KeePass Classic on Windows) previously, you can
		open your existing database. Otherwise we begin
		with creating a new password database.
	</p>
	
	<a name="database_create" />
	<h2>Creating a new password database</h2>
	<p>
		KeePassX stores your password entries into
		a password database file when the it's not running.
		To create a new password database, click the 
		<span class="gui">&quot;New Database&quot;</span>
		icon on the program toolbar (it is the first icon from the 
		left on the toolbar).
	</p>
	<p>
		Second, you need to set the <b>master key</b> for the
		password database. This key is used to encrypt (ie. lock)
		the password database so it cannot be read by anybody
		else but you. The master key can be a password
		or a key file or both.
		If you check both, you must provide both the password
		and the key file to every time you want to unlock the database.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you decide to use a password, 
		<a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-002.html">
		choose and protect it carefully</a> <img src="external.png" />.
		The password should be strong, ie. long enough 
		(at least 8 characters) and preferably contain lower and
		uppercase characters, numbers and special characters (e.g. !#?).
		You should also  memorize the password well, because
		if you forget it, there is no way retrieving it later
		from the locked database. You will be asked
		to give the password twice to ensure that
		there is no typing errors in the password.
	</p>
	<p>
		The key file can be any file on your computer, e.g. a picture or 
		a text document.
		You can also create a randomly-generated key file by first
		selecting the key file check box and clicking 
		<span class="gui">&quot;Generate Key File...&quot;</span>.
		You can store the key file for example on a USB memory stick,
		to keep it with you everywhere.
	</p>
	
	<a name="password_add" />
	<h2>Adding password entries</h2>
	<p>
		After you have created or opened a database, you
		can add password entries to the database.
		A password entry essentially consists of a title,
		user name and password. It may have other entries
		as well, such as URL (Internet link) and comments.
		To add a new password entry, select a group from 
		the list on the left first, then
		click the <span class="gui">
		&quot;Add New Entry&quot;</span> icon on the program toolbar.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the &quot;New Entry&quot; dialog you can enter
		the information you want to into respective text boxes.
		If you are creating a new account to e.g. a web forum,
		you can use the password generator to generate strong
		random passwords for you.
	</p>

	<a name="database_save" />
	<h2>Saving the database</h2>
	<p>
		If you have added or edited entries in your database,
		they are not automatically save to the database file by default.
		You can save the database by clicking the <span class="gui">
		&quot;Save Database&quot;</span> icon. 
	</p>	
	<p>
		You may also want to
		enable <span class="gui">&quot;Automatically save database
		after every change&quot;</span> option from the
		<span class="gui">&quot;Extras&quot;</span> &gt; 
		<span class="gui">&quot;Settings...&quot;</span> &gt;
		<span class="gui">&quot;General (2)&quot;</span> page. 
		(On OS X, the page is found from 
		<span class="gui">&quot;KeePassX&quot;</span> (Application menu) &gt; 
		<span class="gui">&quot;Preferences&quot;</span>.)
	</p>

	<a name="database_open" />
	<h2>Opening a database</h2>
	<p>
		By default, on next startup, KeePassX opens a 
		<span class="gui">&quot;Enter Master Key&quot;</span>
		dialog for the last used password database. If you wish
		to open another password database, click 
		<span class="gui">&quot;Cancel&quot;</span>
		and click <span class="gui">&quot;Open Database&quot;</span> icon
		on the program toolbar and select the wanted password 
		database file from the file system. You can, of course,
		do this at any point when the KeePassX main window is active.
	</p>

	<a name="password_edit" />
	<h2>Editing and removing password entries</h2>
	<p>
		If you wish to edit a password entry, you can do
		so by double-clicking on the entry title,
		or by selecting the entry and then clicking the
		<span class="gui">&quot;View/Edit Entry&quot;</span> icon
		on the program toolbar.
	</p>
	<p>
		To delete a password entry, first select the
		entry and click <span class="gui">&quot;Delete Entry&quot;</span> icon
		on the program toolbar or hit <tt>Ctrl-D</tt> (<tt>Cmd+D</tt> on OS X)
		on the keyboard.
	</p>

	<a name="password_copy" />
	<h2>Copying password (and user name) to the clipboard</h2>
	<p>
		You can copy the currently selected password by hitting <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> 
		(<tt>Cmd-C</tt> on OS X) and user name with <tt>Ctrl-B</tt> (<tt>Cmd-B</tt> 
		on OS X) on the keyboard. Then you can hit <tt>Ctrl-V</tt> 
		(<tt>Cmd-V</tt> on OS X) to paste the password or username
		to any program that supports pasting from the clipboard.
	</p>

	<a name="autotype" />
	<h2>Setup Auto-Type (currently Linux only)</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Auto-Type</b> is a feature that allows you to e.g. log in
		to web page by hitting only one key combination. 
		KeePassX does the rest of the typing for you. Auto-Type reads
		the title of currently active window on your screen
		and matches it to the configured database entries.
		If a matching window title is found from the password
		database, it executes a predefined key sequence 
		(by default your username, <tt>TAB</tt>, password, <tt>ENTER</tt>) in
		the active window. This feature is currently available
		in the Linux version only.
	</p>
	<p>
		To enable Auto-Type, first go to 
		<span class="gui">&quot;Extras&quot;</span> &gt;
		<span class="gui">&quot;Settings...&quot;</span> &gt;
		<span class="gui">&quot;Advanced&quot;</span> page
		and set the <span class="gui">&quot;Global Auto-Type Shortcut&quot;</span>
		by clicking the text box and typing the desired
		keyboard shortcut (e.g. <tt>Ctrl-Shift-N</tt>). 
		Click <span class="gui">&quot;OK&quot;</span> to exit the dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then, for example, open the web page where you 
		want to be able to log in with Auto-Type. Let's
		for example open Google.com into Firefox and
		try to do automated search with Auto-Type. Go
		to Google.com in Firefox and you'll notice
		that your window title is now &quot;Google - Mozilla Firefox&quot;
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, create new password entry, that
		contains user name &quot;test&quot;.
		Then, click the small <span class="gui">&quot;Tools&quot;</span>
		button at the bottom of the <span class="gui">&quot;New Entry&quot;</span>
		dialog, and select <span class="gui">&quot;Auto-Type: Select target window&quot;</span>
		Select &quot;Google - Mozilla Firefox&quot; from the dropdown menu and
		click <span class="gui">&quot;OK&quot;</span>. You should see now a new
		line in the <span class="gui">&quot;Comment:&quot;</span> box, which reads:<br/><br/>
		
		<tt>Auto-Type-Window: Google - Mozilla Firefox</tt><br/><br/>
		
		Now you have associated that window title to this entry.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, let's customize the Auto-Type key sequence
		to just enter your username and hit <tt>ENTER</tt>.
		Click again <span class="gui">&quot;Tools&quot;</span>
		and select <span class="gui">&quot;Auto-Type: Customize Sequence&quot;</span>.
		Now there's another new line in the <span class="gui">&quot;Comment:&quot;</span> box,
		which reads:<br/><br/>
		
		<tt>Auto-Type: {USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}</tt><br/><br/>

		Change this line to:<br/><br/>
		
		<tt>Auto-Type: {USERNAME}{ENTER}</tt><br/><br/>
		
		So that it would just type in your username and hit <tt>ENTER</tt>.
		Click <span class="gui">&quot;OK&quot;</span> to save the entry.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, you can test the Auto-Type by returning to the
		Firefox window and hitting the global Auto-Type keyboard
		shortcut (e.g. <tt>Ctrl-Shift-N</tt>) in it.
		If everything went correctly, KeePassX should now enter
		&quot;test&quot; in the search box and start the search query
		by hitting <tt>ENTER</tt>.
	</p>
	<p>
		By modifing the Auto-Type key sequence you can tailor
		Auto-Type to suit almost every web login page you'll enter.
